<p><b>Description of Role</b> 
<p>The role is highly complex and highly technical. It would be a true test of my future abilities if I was working in this sort of role. Having a basic understanding of what the role entails, the idea of eventually being able to work at this level makes it all very exciting.</p>
<p><b>Description of skills required for the role</b> 
<p>Extensive knowledge and experience with all disciplines of large-scale networks. Extensive knowledge and experience of troubleshooting issues in those large-scale networks. Expert knowledge of at least 1 programming language. In-depth knowledge of a wide range of routing protocols.</p>
<p><b>Description of my own skills</b>
<p>Basic understanding and experience with networking in a large-scale network. Basic experience of troubleshooting issues in a large-scale network. Basic coding experience, mainly html, java and python. Basic knowledge of routing protocols. Extensive experience with installing and maintaining physical large-scale infrastructure. Strong hardware troubleshooting skills, strong application level troubleshooting skills, intermediate experience with installing and configuring windows server. Basic UNIX troubleshooting skills, primarily towards storage and network configurations.</p>
<p><b>Plan for obtaining the skills required</b>
<p>I plan on having the work experience and knowledge for this role after 1-3 years in a Network Security Admin role, eventually making the move into a specialist engineer role and remaining in that role for another 3-4 years. In total, 5-7 years of experience within my current company. The company I currently work operates with large scale networks and would provide the perfect foundation for me to grow my experience.</p>
