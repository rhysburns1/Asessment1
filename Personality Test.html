<p><b>Myers-Briggs Test</b></p>
<p><a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/0fd1b577a8a48">Results</a></p>
<li><b>Type:</b> Assertive Commander</li>
<li><b>Code:</b> ENTJ-A</li>
<li><b>Role:</b> Analyst</li>
<li><b>Strategy:</b> People Mastery</li>
<p>Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal.</p>
<p>Embrace rationality, excelling in intellectual and technological pursuits. The Thinking trait makes Analysts exacting, and the Intuitive trait lets them apply their minds to almost anything, with their imaginations aiding calculated, strategic thinking, or seeing just how far the rabbit hole goes with a crazy scheme or thought experiment.</p>
<p>People Masters are highly stress-resistant, maintaining confidence through life’s challenges, social pressures, and any questions of their capabilities. These personality types seek social contact and have solid communication skills, feeling at ease when relying on or directing other people. People Masters’ mantra is fearless engagement – to be is to do. This is not a group known for its timid opinions or idleness.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Learning Style Test</b></p>
<li><b>Auditory - </b> 30 </li>
<li><b>Visual - </b> 35 </li>
<li><b>Tactile - </b> 35 </li>
<p>Visual/Tactile Learner</p>
<p><b>Visual:</b> If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
<p><b>Tactile:</b> If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Results of Gallup Strength Finder</b></p>
<p><b>Analytical</b> - People exceptionally talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all of the factors that might affect a situation.</p>
<p><b>Achiever</b> - People exceptionally talented in the Achiever theme work hard and possess a great deal of stamina. They take immense satisfaction in being busy and productive.</p>
<p><b>Focus</b> - People exceptionally talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.</p>
<p><b>Includer</b> - People exceptionally talented in the Includer theme accept others. They show awareness of those who feel left out and make an effort to include them.</p>
<p><b>Maximiser</b> - People exceptionally talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.</p>
<br>
<p><b>What do the results mean to me?</b></p>
<p>Knowing how I work and interact in a professional environment; I feel these results are very accurate. I sat down and discussed the results of the Myers-Briggs test with my fiancé and she agreed that these personality traits are accurate. I like to be in control of a situation, because I feel I can deliver the best results. I also know when to relinquish control, if I analyse the situation and feel that what I am doing is not going to be delivering the best results. This situation usually occurs when a task is beyond my experience or my knowledge, I’ll be the first to admit that it is out of my depth. </p>
<p>I believe the People Master attribute to be the most accurate from this personality test, particularly in regards to being stress resistant. I am accustomed to working in a high stress and high pressure environment and I was able to do so with ease, whilst also maintaining an exceptionally high standard of work.</p>
<p>The results of my learning style I mostly agree with. I am a very visual learner, and a very hands on sort of person. However, there is a sentence that describes the tactile part of my learning as not being able to sit still and take frequent breaks that I disagree with. I am very much accustom to putting my head down and getting the work done, and rarely take a full lunch break during the day. </p>
<p>The results of the Gallup Strength finder are used at my current workplace. These results are taken seriously when forming teams as they take your strengths and weaknesses into consideration. I take the results of this very seriously, as I feel it describes my professional personality and my private personality.</p>
<br>
<p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
<p>For me, I like to be in control or maintaining control. So if my team is straying of course, not making deadlines, making mistakes, etc I’ll be attempting to keep them on track. At the moment, I am learning a new role in my profession, so my focus is all on learning and listening, not so much trying to take control.</p>
<p><b>How should take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
<p>When forming a team I think it’s important for one person (or two) to be able to dictate the flow of the workload and manage the outcomes of each member appropriately. In my previous experience from working in the Data Centre, I was the lead of my shift for several years and a senior employee for most of my tenure. I had a lot of success in completing tasks and rarely needing to handover tasks that were scheduled to be completed on my shift as I had managed my/my team’s time effectively. </p>
