<p><b>Description</b></p>

<p>Amazon Web Services is searching for industry-leading Senior Network Development Engineers and Architects to join our network team. We own the design, scalability, and availability of the global networks that power Amazon Web Services. We push our networks to their limit; traditional network vendors simply cannot deliver cost effective solutions capable of meeting our requirements for capacity, availability, or performance. In AWS Networking, we invent, design, refine and then we invent again.</p>

<p>The Data Centre Network Engineering team at AWS work to ensure our customers can access a highly redundant, low latency and high bandwidth network where and when they need it. We do this through redefining the way networking is done at all layers from aggregation, through to our backbone and border connections. Engineers here have the freedom to define the platforms, topologies, routing architectures and software control systems that influence the strategic decision making process for the benefit of our customers.</p>

<p>We are inventing the network of the future so our Engineers require a deep background in routing protocols, and operating large scale networks. In addition to fundamental Networking skills our engineers have Linux experience and background in network automation. SDN is a reality at Amazon and our networks are designed to be fully managed and operated via software systems. Proficiency in Python, Perl, C, or Shell Scripting is required.</p>

<p>Experience leading large cross-functional projects to successful completion and the ability to influence outside of your responsibility are must haves.
It's important to be cross-disciplinary and accustomed to "reaching across the aisle", as you will be working with many hardware, software and customer organizations across Amazon translating customer and business requirements into actual technical solutions.</p>

<p>Why Australia? Our Sydney offices are growing rapidly and you could be part of that! With Engineers based in Sydney, Dublin and Seattle this is an excellent opportunity to join Amazon and build something great. You would be joining a world class technical team, working with some of the biggest and brightest engineers in the industry. Not only would you be working with the best, you would be developing your skills and furthering your career within one of the fastest- growing, most innovative and progressive technology companies in the world.</p>

<p>If you’re up the challenge, we’d love to hear from you!</p>

<br>
<p><b>Basic Qualifications</b></p>

<li>Extensive Experience in Large Scale Networks</li>
<li>Excellent network analysis fundamentals and robust troubleshooting skills; specifically, network performance analysis</li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of and experience with major router platforms; specifically, a deep technical understanding of all internal hardware components and understanding of router system design</li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of and experience with major internet routing protocols; specifically BGP (confederations and complex route reflector topologies), OSPF, MPLS, RSVP and ISIS</li>
<li>Strong Unix/Linux skills and the ability to code in Python, Perl, shell, C or C++</li>
<li>Highly autonomous, very detail oriented, possesses strong written and verbal communication skills</li>
<li>A key influencer in team strategy and goals</li>
<li>Ability to solve ambiguous problems in existing or new network architecture and systems development initiatives</li>
<li>Proven ability to proactively fix architectural and/or process deficiencies</li>
<li>Able to develop and deliver projects that have significant business and/or customer impact</li>
<li>Embody technical leadership for your team including being a coach/mentor within your organisation; able to drive the professional development of others and actively participate in our recruiting efforts.</li>
<li>An appreciation of how systems and coding play a key role in modern networking and a willingness to be hands on in networking software solutions.</li>

<p><b>Preferred Qualifications</b></p>

<li>Background with high availability, high performance compute, large-scale networks and network design and architecture is highly preferred</li>
<li>Good understanding of Computer Science fundamentals, data structures, algorithms and distributed systems</li>
<li>Expert knowledge of network hardware and packet forwarding architectures</li>
<li>In-depth knowledge of and experience with major router platforms; specifically, a deep technical understanding of all internal hardware components and understanding of router system design</li>
